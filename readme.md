# A Geocoding Demonstration

This is a little light on comments, but there's not much source to read.
It's also a little light on organization.

This is just a quick demo I threw together to find out how using the geonames geocoding API works.

It filters a list of sample users I generated based on proximity to a user supplied location.

Demo is [here](http://wevegotwebs.com/geocode/).
